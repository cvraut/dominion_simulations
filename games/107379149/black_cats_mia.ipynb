    "  - An annoying interaction between the two since we would like to use remake to get rid of coppers from our deck. Due to the presence of poor house, the remake would turn coppers into poor houses making it signficantly worse as a trasher.\n",
    "- Black cat - Way of the frog\n",
    "  - If we know in advance that it is very likely that our opponent will buy a green card in the following turn (for example right after securing a vp lead), we can use way of the frog to top-deck black cats as a way to attack our opponent or dissuade them from purchasing green cards.\n",
    "- Mastermind - Way of the frog\n",
    "  - Similar to the previous interaction we can use way of the frog to topdeck cards we have in our hand now, that we would like to mastermind in the following turn. Ideally you would want to mastermind a draw card like black cat or hunting grounds due to the lack of trashing on the board.\n",

I needed to score at least 4 points this turn to take the lead. I was planning on converting the poor house --> estate, converting the wandering minstrel --> duchy, and purchasing a province giving myself a 7-point lead over my opponent. This would then let me top-deck 2 black cats via way of the frog effectively giving myself a 9-point lead over my opponent. I knew my opponent had 5 black cats in his deck (I had the remaining 5). The previous turn my opponent had triggered a fresh shuffle without top-decking any black cats.

    "My rational was that 5 black cats in 25 cards, I expect my opponent to have at least 1, maybe 2, very lucky if 3+ in their opening hand. I put my odds of receiving 2 curses or less at ~80%. This was not empirically driven, but in trying to apply quick gameplay reasoning... The first 5 cards can be estimated to be random samples from a binomial(p=0.2) which has an expected value of 1 with variance of 0.8. Within 2 standard deviations, we can expect to see about 2 black cats. Factoring in arithmetic errors, I gave this play about an 80% chance of working the way I wanted it to."
